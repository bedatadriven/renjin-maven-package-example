# Example Renjin Package with Apache Maven 

This is an example of writing and building an R package for 
Renjin using the Apache Maven build tool.

This example includes Java source alongside the R-language package,
and uses the conventional Maven/gradle directory layout rather than
the GNU R package layout.

The advantage of this approach is that such packages can fit more 
naturally into existing JVM-based workflows and tooling.
